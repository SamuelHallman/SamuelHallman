### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am studying computer science at LAB University of Applied Sciences. I'm completing my second year, so I'm looking for an internship for the summer. I am a hard worker and a quick learner. I got a reputation for working overtime at my previous job. I always get my work done on time.
